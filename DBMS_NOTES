✅ Unit I: Introduction to DBMS
📘 1. What is DBMS?
🔹 DBMS (Database Management System) is a software system that:

Stores, organizes, and manages data

Allows easy access, updating, and retrieval of data

Provides security, consistency, and concurrent access

🗂️ Example: MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQL Server

✅ Key Advantages of Using a DBMS:
Advantage	Explanation
Data Redundancy Control	Avoids duplication of data
Data Consistency	Ensures all users see the same data
Data Security	Controls who can access/modify the data
Backup & Recovery	Automatically handles data recovery after failure
Concurrent Access	Multiple users can access data at the same time without conflict
Data Integrity	Ensures correctness and validity of data
Data Independence	Allows changes in structure without affecting applications
👥 2. Roles in a DBMS Environment
🔹 Database Users:
Type	Role
End Users	Use the database for querying, entering, or analyzing data (e.g., students using a result portal)
Application Programmers	Write programs that interact with the database
Database Designers	Design the structure (schema) of the database
System Analysts	Design database-based applications
🔹 Database Administrator (DBA):

The main person in charge of managing the database

Responsibilities:

Installing DBMS software

Managing users and permissions

Tuning performance

Creating backups

Ensuring data security and recovery

🏛️ 3. Database System Architecture

The architecture defines how the database system is structured and how users interact with it.

🔹 Three-Schema Architecture (Very Important Concept)

It divides the system into 3 levels to separate user views from physical storage:

Schema Level	Description
1. External Level (View Level)	What the user sees (user-specific view of data)
2. Conceptual Level (Logical Level)	The overall structure of the entire database (tables, relationships, constraints)
3. Internal Level (Physical Level)	How the data is physically stored on disk (indexes, files, blocks, etc.)

This separation allows data independence.

🔄 4. Data Independence

Data independence means the ability to change the schema at one level without affecting the others.

🔹 Types:
Type	Description
Logical Data Independence	Changing the conceptual (logical) schema without changing user views
Physical Data Independence	Changing the internal (physical) schema without changing the logical structure

🧠 Why it matters: It makes the system more flexible and easier to maintain.

✅ Summary of Unit I:
Topic	Key Idea
What is DBMS	Software to manage, store, and access databases
Advantages	Security, backup, consistency, multi-user access, etc.
Users	End users, programmers, designers, and DBAs
Three-Schema Architecture	Separates view, logical structure, and physical storage
Data Independence	Change one level without affecting others
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✅ Unit II: Data Modeling (ER Model)
🗂️ 1. What is Data Modeling?

Data modeling is the process of creating a visual representation of the data and its relationships within a system. It helps in designing databases clearly before actual implementation.

🧩 2. ER (Entity-Relationship) Model Basics

The ER Model uses diagrams to represent the data and its structure.

🔹 Entities

An entity represents a real-world object or concept that can be distinguished from others.

Examples: Student, Course, Employee

Usually represented by a rectangle in ER diagrams.

🔹 Attributes

Properties or details that describe an entity.

Examples: Student has attributes like Student_ID, Name, Age.

Represented by ovals connected to entities.

🔹 Keys

Primary Key is an attribute (or set of attributes) that uniquely identifies each entity instance.

Example: Student_ID uniquely identifies a student.

🔹 Relationships

Describes how entities are related to each other.

Examples: Student enrolls in Course.

Represented by diamonds in ER diagrams.

🔄 3. Extending ER Models

Real-world data can be complex, so ER models have some extensions:

🔹 a. Weak Entities

Entities that cannot be uniquely identified by their own attributes alone.

They depend on a related strong entity.

Example: Dependent entity (like a child) depends on the Employee entity.

Represented by a double rectangle.

Has a partial key (underlined with a dashed line).

Connected to strong entity with a double diamond.

🔹 b. Inheritance (or Generalization & Specialization)

Mechanism to model hierarchical relationships between entities.

Helps to represent “is-a” relationships.

Term	Meaning	Example
Generalization	Combining several lower-level entities into a higher-level entity	Student and Teacher → Person
Specialization	Dividing a higher-level entity into lower-level entities	Employee → Manager, Engineer

Represented by a triangle connecting the parent and child entities.

✅ Summary Table:
Concept	Description	Symbol in ER Diagram
Entity	Object or thing with data	Rectangle
Attribute	Property of an entity	Oval
Key	Unique identifier	Underlined attribute
Relationship	Link between entities	Diamond
Weak Entity	Entity dependent on strong entity	Double rectangle
Generalization	Combining entities into one	Triangle (pointing up)
Specialization	Dividing entity into subtypes	Triangle (pointing down)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✅ Unit III: Relational Model & Constraints
🗃️ 1. Relational Model Basics

The Relational Model is the foundation of most modern databases.

🔹 Relational Schema

Defines the structure of a relation (table).

Specifies the table name and its attributes (columns).

Example:
Student(Student_ID, Name, Age, Major)
Here, Student is the relation (table) and the rest are attributes.

🔹 Tuples

A tuple is a row in a table.

Represents a single record in the relation.

Example:
(101, "Alice", 20, "CS") is a tuple in the Student relation.

🔹 Relation

A relation is a table with rows (tuples) and columns (attributes).

Each relation represents a set of similar entities or relationships.

🔐 2. Integrity Constraints

Constraints ensure data accuracy and consistency.

Constraint Type	Description	Example
Domain Constraint	Values of an attribute must come from a defined domain (data type, range)	Age must be integer between 18-60
Key Constraint	Ensures each tuple is uniquely identifiable	Student_ID is the primary key
Entity Integrity	Primary key attributes cannot be NULL	Student_ID cannot be null
Referential Integrity	Foreign keys must match primary keys in related tables	Course_ID in Enrollment must exist in Course table
🔄 3. Update Operations

Databases support these basic operations:

Operation	Description
INSERT	Add new tuples (rows) to a table
DELETE	Remove tuples from a table
UPDATE	Modify existing tuples
⚠️ 4. Handling Constraint Violations

When performing updates, violations can occur if constraints are not followed.

Violation Type	What Happens	Example
Primary Key Violation	Attempting to insert duplicate or NULL key value	Trying to add a student with existing Student_ID
Referential Integrity Violation	Deleting a tuple referenced by a foreign key	Trying to delete a course that has enrolled students
Domain Violation	Inserting invalid data type or value	Entering 'abc' in Age field
How DBMS Handles Violations:

Reject the operation and show an error.

Some systems allow cascading actions (e.g., deleting dependent records automatically).

✅ Summary Table:
Topic	Key Points
Relational Schema	Defines table structure and attributes
Tuples	Rows representing records
Relations	Tables containing tuples
Integrity Constraints	Rules to ensure data validity (key, domain, referential)
Update Operations	Insert, delete, update data
Constraint Violations	Errors that occur if rules are broken



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✅ Unit IV: Relational Algebra & Calculus
🧮 1. Relational Algebra

Relational Algebra is a procedural query language used to query relational databases. It uses operators to perform operations on relations (tables) to produce new relations.

🔹 Basic Operators of Relational Algebra
Operator	Purpose	Explanation	Example
SELECT (σ)	Select rows	Picks rows that satisfy a condition	σ (Age > 20)(Student) selects students older than 20
PROJECT (π)	Select columns	Chooses specific columns from a relation	π (Name, Age)(Student) gets only Name and Age columns
UNION (∪)	Combine tuples	Combines tuples from two relations (no duplicates)	Student_2023 ∪ Student_2024
SET DIFFERENCE (−)	Subtract tuples	Tuples in one relation but not in the other	Student − Graduated_Students
CARTESIAN PRODUCT (×)	Combine tuples	Combines every tuple of one relation with every tuple of another	Student × Course
JOIN	Combine related tuples	Combines tuples based on a matching attribute	Student ⨝ Enrollment on Student_ID
DIVISION (÷)	Find tuples related to all tuples	Returns tuples related to all tuples in another relation	Find students who took all courses
📝 2. Relational Calculus

Relational Calculus is a non-procedural query language, which means you describe what you want rather than how to get it.

There are two types:

a) Tuple Relational Calculus (TRC)

Queries specify conditions on tuples (rows).

Uses variables that represent tuples.

Example query: Find all students t where t.Age > 20.

{ t | Student(t) AND t.Age > 20 }

b) Domain Relational Calculus (DRC)

Queries specify conditions on attribute values (domains).

Uses variables that represent attribute values.

Example query: Find all students with age > 20.

{ <x, y, z> | Student(x, y, z) AND y > 20 }
Here, x, y, z represent attribute values like Student_ID, Name, Age.

✅ Summary Table:
Concept	What It Does	Example
Relational Algebra	Procedural; uses operators to manipulate relations	π(Name)(σ(Age>20)(Student))
Select (σ)	Selects rows based on condition	σ(Age>20)(Student)
Project (π)	Selects columns	π(Name, Age)(Student)
Join	Combines related tuples	Student ⨝ Enrollment
Division (÷)	Finds tuples related to all tuples in another relation	Students who took all courses
Tuple Relational Calculus	Non-procedural; describes tuples	`{ t
Domain Relational Calculus	Non-procedural; describes attribute values	`{ <x,y,z> }


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✅ Unit V: SQL (Structured Query Language)
🛠️ 1. DDL and DML
🔹 DDL (Data Definition Language)

Used to define and modify the database structure.

Common commands:

CREATE — create tables, databases, indexes.

ALTER — modify existing table structure.

DROP — delete tables or databases.

In DDL, you specify data types and constraints (rules).

Example:

CREATE TABLE Student (
  Student_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
  Name VARCHAR(50),
  Age INT CHECK (Age >= 18)
);

🔹 DML (Data Manipulation Language)

Used to manage data inside tables.

Common commands:

INSERT — add new data.

UPDATE — modify existing data.

DELETE — remove data.

🔍 2. SQL Queries
🔹 SELECT Queries

Retrieve data from one or more tables.

Type	Explanation	Example
Simple SELECT	Retrieve specific columns or all data	SELECT Name, Age FROM Student;
Complex SELECT	Use conditions, joins, groupings	
SELECT Name, Age FROM Student WHERE Age > 20 ORDER BY Name;

🔹 INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
Command	Purpose	Example
INSERT	Add new row	INSERT INTO Student VALUES (101, 'Alice', 21);
UPDATE	Change existing data	UPDATE Student SET Age=22 WHERE Student_ID=101;
DELETE	Remove rows	DELETE FROM Student WHERE Student_ID=101;
👁️‍🗨️ 3. Views

A view is a virtual table created by a query.

It does not store data physically but shows data dynamically based on the underlying tables.

Used for:

Simplifying complex queries.

Providing restricted access to data.

Example:

CREATE VIEW YoungStudents AS
SELECT Name, Age FROM Student WHERE Age < 25;

⚙️ 4. Advanced Retrieval Techniques

JOINs: Combine rows from two or more tables based on related columns.

Example of INNER JOIN:

SELECT Student.Name, Course.CourseName
FROM Student
JOIN Enrollment ON Student.Student_ID = Enrollment.Student_ID
JOIN Course ON Enrollment.Course_ID = Course.Course_ID;


Aggregate Functions: SUM, AVG, COUNT, MAX, MIN to summarize data.

GROUP BY: Group rows sharing a property for aggregation.

HAVING: Filter groups (like WHERE but for groups).

✅ Summary Table:
Topic	Key Points
DDL	Commands to create and modify database structure
DML	Commands to insert, update, delete data
SELECT	Retrieve data, simple or with conditions
Views	Virtual tables based on queries
Advanced Retrieval	Joins, aggregate functions, grouping


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✅ Unit VI: Relational Database Design
🏗️ 1. Mapping ER-to-Relational Schemas

When you design a database, you first create an ER diagram to model entities and relationships.

Mapping means converting that ER model into relational tables (schemas).

Basic mappings:

ER Concept	Relational Schema
Entity	Table with attributes as columns
Relationship	Table or foreign keys depending on cardinality
Weak Entity	Table with foreign key referencing strong entity
Generalization/Specialization	Tables for parent and child entities
🔄 2. Functional Dependencies (FDs)

A functional dependency is a constraint between two sets of attributes in a relation.

It means if you know value(s) of attribute(s) X, you can determine value(s) of attribute(s) Y.

Notation:
X → Y means "X functionally determines Y".

Example:
Student_ID → Name (Knowing Student_ID gives you Name).

📏 3. Normalization

Normalization is the process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and avoid anomalies (problems when inserting, deleting, or updating data).

It involves several normal forms (NFs):

Normal Form	Description	Key Points
1NF (First Normal Form)	Eliminate repeating groups; atomic values only	Each column has indivisible values
2NF (Second Normal Form)	Meet 1NF + remove partial dependencies	No attribute depends only on part of a composite key
3NF (Third Normal Form)	Meet 2NF + remove transitive dependencies	Non-key attributes depend only on the key
BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)	Stronger version of 3NF	Every determinant is a candidate key
4NF (Fourth Normal Form)	Deals with multi-valued dependencies	No independent multi-valued facts
🧩 4. Relational Decomposition Properties

When decomposing tables to achieve normalization, these properties are important:

Property	Meaning
Lossless Join	Decomposition should allow original relation to be perfectly reconstructed by joining decomposed tables
Dependency Preservation	Functional dependencies should be preserved without needing to join tables
Normalization Trade-offs	Sometimes, a balance is needed between normalization and performance
✅ Summary Table:
Topic	Explanation
ER to Relational Mapping	Converting entities and relationships into tables
Functional Dependencies	Rules showing attribute relationships
Normalization	Organizing tables to remove redundancy and anomalies (1NF to 4NF, BCNF)
Decomposition Properties	Ensuring decomposition is lossless and preserves dependencies

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✅ Unit VII: Transaction Processing
🔄 1. Core Concepts of Transactions

A transaction is a sequence of database operations (like read, write) treated as a single logical unit.

It must either be fully completed or fully undone — no partial results.

Example: Transferring money between accounts involves multiple steps, all must succeed or none.

🔐 2. ACID Properties

These properties guarantee reliable transaction processing:

Property	Meaning	Explanation
Atomicity	All or nothing	Either all operations succeed or none do (rollback on failure)
Consistency	Database rules preserved	Transactions must leave the database in a valid state
Isolation	Concurrent transactions don’t interfere	Results appear as if transactions were executed sequentially
Durability	Once committed, changes persist	Committed data is saved permanently even after crashes
🗓️ 3. Schedule Recoverability and Serializability

A schedule is the order in which operations from multiple transactions are executed.

🔹 Recoverability

A schedule is recoverable if transactions commit only after all transactions they depend on commit.

This prevents cascading rollbacks (undoing multiple transactions because one failed).

🔹 Serializability

The goal is to ensure correctness when multiple transactions run concurrently.

A schedule is serializable if its outcome is the same as some serial execution (one transaction after another without overlap).

Types:

Conflict Serializability: No conflicting operations reorderable.

View Serializability: Based on read/write operations having the same final effect.

✅ Summary Table:
Topic	Explanation
Transaction	A logical unit of DB operations
ACID	Ensures transaction reliability: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability
Schedule	Order of interleaved operations
Recoverability	Ensures safe commits, avoids cascading rollbacks
Serializability	Ensures concurrent transactions produce correct results

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unit VIII: Concurrency Control
Why is Concurrency Control Important?

In databases, many users can access and modify data at the same time.

Without control, simultaneous operations can cause problems like:

Lost updates (one user’s change overwrites another’s)

Dirty reads (reading uncommitted data)

Inconsistent data

Concurrency control ensures that even when multiple users access the database simultaneously, the data remains consistent and correct.

Key Concurrency Control Techniques
1. Two-Phase Locking (2PL)

Transactions lock the data they access to prevent conflicts.

Two phases in a transaction:

Growing phase: Locks are acquired but none released.

Shrinking phase: Locks are released but none acquired.

Ensures that transactions appear to run one after another (serializable).

Prevents problems like dirty reads and lost updates.

2. Timestamp Ordering

Assigns a unique timestamp to each transaction based on its start time.

Transactions are ordered by their timestamps.

Rules ensure that operations occur in timestamp order.

If a transaction violates order (e.g., tries to write an old version of data), it is rolled back.

Ensures consistency without using locks.

3. Multiversion Concurrency Control (MVCC)

Instead of locking, multiple versions of data items are stored.

Readers access a snapshot of the data (a consistent version) so they don’t block writers.

Writers create new versions without interfering with readers.

Provides high concurrency and better performance for read-heavy systems.

4. Optimistic Validation and Snapshot Isolation

Optimistic Validation:

Transactions execute without locks.

At commit time, system checks for conflicts.

If conflict found, transaction rolls back.

Best when conflicts are rare.

Snapshot Isolation:

Each transaction works on a snapshot of the database at a certain time.

Provides consistent reads without locking.

Transactions don’t see uncommitted changes by others.

Widely used in modern databases for balancing performance and consistency.

Summary Table
Technique	How it Works	Benefit
Two-Phase Locking (2PL)	Acquire and release locks in two phases	Ensures serializability, avoids conflicts
Timestamp Ordering	Orders transactions by timestamps	No locks needed, ensures order
Multiversion Concurrency Control (MVCC)	Multiple versions of data for readers/writers	High concurrency, no reader blocking
Optimistic Validation & Snapshot Isolation	Transactions check conflicts at commit, work on snapshots	Efficient when conflicts are rare, consistent reads

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✅ Unit IX: Database Recovery Techniques
Why Recovery is Important?

Databases can fail due to system crashes, power outages, or software bugs.

Recovery techniques ensure the database is restored to a consistent state after failure, without losing committed transactions.

Key Recovery Methods
1. Deferred Update (No-Undo/Redo)

Changes made by a transaction are not applied immediately to the database.

Instead, all updates are recorded in a log and applied only when the transaction commits.

If failure occurs before commit, no changes are made (no undo needed).

If failure occurs after commit, changes are reapplied (redo) during recovery.

Summary:

No Undo: Because uncommitted changes are never applied.

Redo: Apply committed changes from the log after crash.

2. Immediate Update (Undo/Redo)

Changes made by a transaction are immediately applied to the database.

Before modifying data, the old values are saved in a log.

If a transaction fails or the system crashes:

Undo: Roll back changes of incomplete transactions using the log.

Redo: Reapply changes of committed transactions using the log.

3. Shadow Paging

Keeps two copies of the database pages:

Current pages: actively used by transactions.

Shadow pages: unchanged copy saved before updates.

When a transaction commits, changes are made to current pages and shadow pages are updated.

If failure occurs, database reverts to shadow pages (unchanged state).

Avoids the need for logs, but managing shadow pages can be complex.

4. Backup and Restoration

Regular backups save database copies to external storage.

Types of backups:

Full backup: complete copy of the database.

Incremental backup: only changes since last backup.

After catastrophic failures, backups are used to restore the database to a recent consistent state.

Combined with transaction logs, backup and restore ensure minimal data loss.

✅ Summary Table:
Technique	How it Works	Undo Needed?	Redo Needed?	Notes
Deferred Update	Apply updates only at commit	No	Yes	Simple recovery, no undo log
Immediate Update	Apply updates immediately	Yes	Yes	More flexible but complex log
Shadow Paging	Keep shadow copy of database pages	No	No	Avoids logs, complex page management
Backup and Restore	Save copies externally for recovery	Depends	Depends	Used after catastrophic failure
